ASTR380: Observational Astronomy
================================

This folder includes tutorials and data analysis notebooks for the Fall 2019
semester of ASTR380, Observational Astronomy.

Motivation
----------

This document assembles a few notes and resources to help you get started with
summer research.  Although research is very rewarding, frequently it can also be
extremely frustrating!  My best advice is for you to try to keep your eye on the
*big picture* of what you're trying to accomplish, and know that the struggle is
oftentimes just as important as the end result.  Indeed, we learn by struggling,
and sometimes the greatest insights and discoveries are made when things appear
to be most bleak!

You should also not hesitate to help out one another.  Research is almost always
a *collaborative* process; for example, I strongly encourage you to `pair
code`_.  We will also use `slack`_ to stay in frequent contact.  Like tackling a
hard quantum physics problem with a group of students, research is best done in
small groups and teams who communicate often.

What you need
-------------

1. We will be using a variety of software repositories hosted at `Github`_ so if
   you don't already have one please create a `Github`_ account and let me know
   your handle so I can give you access to the `siena-astrophysics`_ and
   `legacyhalos`_ repositories.  In addition, you will need to create a `slack`_
   account (and send me the email address you used for your account).

2. A good lab book--or you might consider keeping an electronic journal or set
   of notes (ideally, on Github!).

3. Enthusiasm!

Building your toolkit
---------------------

To start building your technical toolkit you will be working through several
lessons and tutorials from `Software Carpentry`_ on other online resources.

* `The Unix Shell`_
* `Absolute Beginner's Guide to EMACS`_
* `Programming with Python`_
* `Version Control with Git`_ (see also `Git Immersion`_)
