Moustakas Summer 2017 Research Group: Getting Started
=====================================================

Motivation
----------

This document assembles a few notes and resources to help you get started with
summer research.  Although engaging in research is very rewarding, it can
also--at times--be extremely frustrating!  My best advice is for you to try to
keep your eye on the "big picture" of what you're trying to accomplish, and know
that the struggle is oftentimes just as important as the end result.  Indeed, we
learn by struggling, and sometimes the greatest insights and discoveries are
made when things appear to be most bleak!

Learning Goals
--------------

My learning goals for you this summer are two-fold.  First, you will develop
some competency (and hopefully an expertise!) in some of the technical skills
astronomers use to do science.  However, most, if not all of the skills you're
going to learn are not just limited to astronomy; they are used across a myriad
of disciplines in both academia and industry.  So this skillset will serve you
well while you're at Siena College and beyond.

And second, you will learn a lot of astrophysics by reading published papers and
by discussing ideas with me and your peers.  


What you need
-------------

1. We will be using a variety of software repositories hosted at
   [Github](https://github.com) so if you don't already have one please create a
   [Github](https://github.com) account and let me know your handle so I can
   give you access to our
   [siena-astrophysics](https://github.com/moustakas/siena-astrophysics)
   repository.  

2. A good lab book or you might consider keeping an electronic journal or set of
   notes (ideally, on Github!).

3. Enthusiasm!
