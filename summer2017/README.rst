Moustakas Summer 2017 Research Group
====================================

Motivation
----------

This document assembles a few notes and resources to help you get started with
summer research.  Although research is very rewarding, frequently it can also be
extremely frustrating!  My best advice is for you to try to keep your eye on the
*big picture* of what you're trying to accomplish, and know that the struggle is
oftentimes just as important as the end result.  Indeed, we learn by struggling,
and sometimes the greatest insights and discoveries are made when things appear
to be most bleak!

Learning Goals
--------------

My learning goals for you this summer are two-fold.

First, you will develop some competency (and hopefully an expertise!) in some of
the technical skills astronomers use to do science.  However, most, if not all
of the skills you're going to learn are not just limited to astronomy; they are
used across a myriad of disciplines in both academia and industry.  So this
skillset will serve you well while you're at Siena College and beyond.

And second, you will learn a lot of astrophysics by reading published papers and
by discussing ideas with me and your peers.

What you need
-------------

1. We will be using a variety of software repositories hosted at `Github`_ so if
   you don't already have one please create a `Github`_ account and let me know
   your handle so I can give you access to our `siena-astrophysics`_ repository.

2. A good lab book--or you might consider keeping an electronic journal or set
   of notes (ideally, on Github!).

3. Enthusiasm!

NSF Training
------------

The NSF requires you to complete an online `Responsible Conduct of Research`_
training program, in which you will learn about collaborative research,
responsible authorship, data management, etc.  This training must be completed
during the first week of your summer research experience.

Building your toolkit
---------------------

To start building your technical toolkit you will be working through several
lessons and tutorials from `Software Carpentry`_ on other online resources.

* `The Unix Shell`_
* `Programming with Python`_
* `Scipy Lecture Notes`_
* `Version Control with Git`_
* `Practical Python for Astronomers`_

Additional resources
--------------------

Some additional resources you may find useful include:

* `The Foundations of Data Science`_

Need to add:
------------

* Logging into nyx
* gitmersion
* pair coding
* emacs
* Pep8
* Stackexchange
