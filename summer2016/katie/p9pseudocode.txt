Planet 9 Pseudocode for tractor data DR3

planet9dr3

Import list of known asteroids

#Check sigma for g, r, and z
Set det_g = sigma(g) > 5
Set det_r = sigma(r) > 5
Set det_z = sigma(z) < 1

# Remove WISE data by checking sigma
Set no_w1 = sigma(WISE 0) < 5
Set no_w2 = sigma(WISE 1) < 5

# Check data against certain constraints to find 'good' objects
Set good = byte array of n_elements(cat) + 1
Check if objects in good match up with sigma standards for g, ,r and z
Check if objects in good have 1 image contributing in each filter (g, r, and z)
Check if objects in good are in bounds of the brick
Check if the images satisfy each condition in each filter (g, r, and z)
Check if the image contains a very bright star in the blob
Check if the flux ratios are < 0.1 for each filter (g, ,r, and z)
Check if the fraction of pixels masked from the object is < 0.1 for each filter
(g, r, and z)

Check if objects in good match up with sigma standards for no_w1 and no_w2

If objects in good are bright
   flux in the g filter > 1 and flux in the r filter >1

if the total number of objects in good is 0 
   print good

Set wgood = objects in good
Match ra and dec of object against ra and dec of all known asteroids
Remove objects that match up with objects in known asteroids list

print good
