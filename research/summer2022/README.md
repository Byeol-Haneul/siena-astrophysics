Moustakas Summer 2022 Research Group
====================================

Overview
--------

This document assembles a few notes and resources to help you get started with
summer research.  Although research is very rewarding, it can also frequently be
extremely frustrating!  My best advice is for you to try to keep your eye on the
*big picture* of what you're trying to accomplish and know that the struggle is
oftentimes just as important as the end result.  Indeed, we often learn best by
struggling, and sometimes the greatest insights and discoveries are made when
things appear to be most bleak!

You should also not hesitate to help out one another.  Research is almost always
a *collaborative* process; for example, I strongly encourage you to [pair
code](https://stackify.com/pair-programming-advantages).  We will also use
[Slack](https://slack.com) and, occasionally, [Zoom](https://zoom.us) to stay in
frequent contact.  Like tackling a hard quantum physics problem with a group of
classmates, research is best done in small groups and teams who communicate
often.

Finally, at its heart, modern astrophysics is an applied data science:
Astronomers frequently mine large datasets---using one or more modern
programming languages like Python---in order to gain scientifically interesting
insight from those data. Throughout this journey, a good understanding of
statistics is crucial, as well as the ability to clearly communicate your
findings to your peers, both in writing and orally.

What do I need to get started?
------------------------------

We will be using many of the same collaboration tools used by astronomers, as
well as some more specialized and proprietary access to data and computing
resources specific to my research group. Therefore, before the start of summer
research, please be sure you have the following:

1. A [Slack](https://slack.com) account so you can be added to the
[Slack@siena-astrophysics](https://siena-astrophysics.slack.com) workspace.

2. A [Github](https://github.com) account. Once you have your handle, please
   share it with me on Slack so I can give you access to the
   [siena-astrophysics](https://github.com/moustakas/siena-astrophysics)
   repository (and other relevant repositories).

3. ..



Finally, I recommend a good lab book (or you might consider keeping an
electronic journal or set of notes, ideally, on Github!) and enthusiasm!

NSF Training
------------

The grant which is supporting you this summer (whether from the National Science
Foundation or the Department of Energy) mandates that you complete an online
[Responsible Conduct of Research](https://about.citiprogram.org/en/homepage)
training program, in which you will learn about collaborative research,
responsible authorship, data management, etc.  *If you haven't already done it,
this training must be completed during the first week of your summer research
experience.*

Computers and more!
-------------------

The astrophysics research lab (Roger Bacon 113, ask me for the key code) has
several computers that you are free to use.  We will discuss how to access these
machines, my remote server *nyx*, the Siena College high-performance
computing cluster (HPCC), and other computational tools during your first week
of research.

Building your toolkit
---------------------

To start building your technical toolkit you will be working through several
lessons and tutorials from [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/lessons) on other online resources.

* [The Unix Shell](http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice)
* [Absolute Beginner's Guide to EMACS](http://www.jesshamrick.com/2012/09/10/absolute-beginners-guide-to-emacs)
* [Programming with Python](http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation)
* [Version Control with Git](http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice) (see also [Git Immersion](http://gitimmersion.com/)) 

Additional resources
--------------------
Some additional resources you may find useful include:

* [Google's Python Class](https://developers.google.com/edu/python)
* [The Foundations of Data Science](https://ds8.gitbooks.io/textbook/content)
* [Scipy Lecture Notes](http://www.scipy-lectures.org/index.html)
* [Practical Python for Astronomers](https://python4astronomers.github.io)
* [Python Data Science Handbook](https://github.com/jakevdp/PythonDataScienceHandbook)
* [PEP 8 - Style Guide for Python Code](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)
* [Learning Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax)

Papers and software packages
----------------------------

Write me!

This summer's research project focuses on understanding galaxy formation using
imaging and spectroscopy from the [Mapping Nearby Galaxies at APO
(MaNGA)](https://www.sdss.org/surveys/manga) survey. A non-exhaustive list of
relevant papers and software packages with which you will need to become
familiar include:

* [MaNGA Web portal](https://www.sdss.org/surveys/manga)
* [Marvin tool for accessing MaNGA data](https://www.sdss.org/dr15/manga/marvin)
* [Overview of the SDSS-IV MaNGA Survey: Mapping nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015ApJ...798....7B/abstract)

Need to add:
------------
* Logging into nyx.
* Jupyter notebook daily log.
* Anaconda/conda.
