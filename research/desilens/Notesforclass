Redownloaded everything
Read the Readme files and tried to understand some of what the code is doing
Took some notes on how to create a spectra
Still struggling
The path I was in attempting to run a test spectra was: siena-astrophysics/research/desisim-testdata/desi/spectro/templates/basic-templates/v2.0
Which contains fits files of elg, bgs,lrg, quasars, stars, wd (not sure what wd is)


Install xcode, install desiutil using github
Class
desisim.templates import ELGdef 
make_templates()
units of flux = ergs/sec/cm^2/Aplt.plot(wave, flux[0, :])

flux, wave, meta = elg.make_template(model=n, seed=x)
LRG normalized in z band
ELG normalized in r band
look at speclite.fliters for list of curves
what redshift
relative flux

Derive lens rates - rates at which we see lenses we put in

Parameters to vary:
    Source - backgroud ELG because the breaks will be stronger than an LRG, the numbers game - ELG are more common at a redshift of 1-2 z which is 8 Gye
        Apparent Mag - r_source
        Redshift z
        Reshift between source and lens
        
    Lens - forground LRG because they only have one break and it will be easier to see the ELG on top and the mass of the dark matter halo, LRG tend to have massive halos "Biased" tracers of the density field
        Apparent Mag - r_lens
        Redshift - r_L

The relative brightness matters 
    f_source/f_lens = 10^-0.4(r_s-r_L)
    roughly from (almost 0) to 1
Absolute brightness does matter
    20 < r_L < 22
We wont vary the r_s because we can solve for it with fs/fl and rl
z of the lens (0.3 - 0.7) not always an equal probability
z of the source (0.8 - 1.6) we are not going to go any higher than 1.6 becuase of OII

Right now we are going to start a LaTeX document for the paper, documentclass(aastex)
three panel figure
math with some text to explain what I am doing
sketch of the geometry with lensing equation
Make a figure of a gaussian distribution of r_L values with a mean of 21 and some sigma - an input prior 
    fs/fl on y
    uniform from 10^-2  to 1 in logspace
    then combine them to make a histogram of rs
    
Make a figure with the refactered code from our example to specify the zl,zs,f 
def ____ (zl,zs,f,r_l):
returns wave flux of the lens and flux of the source
make a three by three figure from fs/fl big to fs/fl small
ONLY CHANGE F
