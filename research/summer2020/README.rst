Moustakas Summer 2020 Research Group
====================================

Motivation
----------

This document assembles a few notes and resources to help you get started with
summer research.  Although research is very rewarding, frequently it can also be
extremely frustrating!  My best advice is for you to try to keep your eye on the
*big picture* of what you're trying to accomplish, and know that the struggle is
oftentimes just as important as the end result.  Indeed, we learn by struggling,
and sometimes the greatest insights and discoveries are made when things appear
to be most bleak!

You should also not hesitate to help out one another.  Research is almost always
a *collaborative* process; for example, I strongly encourage you to `pair
code`_.  We will also use `Slack`_ and `Zoom`_ to stay in frequent contact.
Like tackling a hard quantum physics problem with a group of classmates,
research is best done in small groups and teams who communicate often.

What you need
-------------

1. We will be using a variety of software repositories hosted at `Github`_ so if
   you don't already have one please create a `Github`_ account and let me know
   your handle so I can give you access to the `siena-astrophysics`_ and
   `legacyhalos`_ repositories.  In addition, you will need to create a `Slack`_
   account (and send me the email address you used for your account).

2. A good lab book--or you might consider keeping an electronic journal or set
   of notes (ideally, on Github!).

3. Enthusiasm!

NSF Training
------------

The NSF requires you to complete an online `Responsible Conduct of Research`_
training program, in which you will learn about collaborative research,
responsible authorship, data management, etc.  *If you haven't already done it,
this training must be completed during the first week of your summer research
experience.*

Computers and more!
-------------------

The astrophysics research lab (Roger Bacon 113, ask me for the key code) has
several computers that you are free to use.  We will discuss how to access these
machines, my remote server *nyx*, the Siena College high-performance
computing cluster (HPCC), and other computational tools during your first week
of research.

Building your toolkit
---------------------

To start building your technical toolkit you will be working through several
lessons and tutorials from `Software Carpentry`_ on other online resources.

* `The Unix Shell`_
* `Absolute Beginner's Guide to EMACS`_
* `Programming with Python`_
* `Version Control with Git`_ (see also `Git Immersion`_)

Additional resources
--------------------
Some additional resources you may find useful include:

* `Google's Python Class`_
* `The Foundations of Data Science`_
* `Scipy Lecture Notes`_
* `Practical Python for Astronomers`_
* `Python Data Science Handbook`_
* `PEP 8 - Style Guide for Python Code`_


Papers and software packages
----------------------------

This summer's research projects focus on understanding the formation of the most
massive galaxies in the universe and their co-evolution with the growth of dark
matter halos.  A non-exhaustive list of relevant papers and software packages
with which you will need to become familiar include:

* `Overview of the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys`_
* `The Connection between Galaxies and their Dark Matter Halos`_
* `First results from the IllustrisTNG simulations: the stellar mass content of groups and clusters of galaxies`_
* `Halotools`_

Need to add:
------------
* Logging into nyx.
* Jupyter notebook daily log.
* Anaconda/conda.
