generalcode.py - A python code used to normalize and optimize physical parameters of kepler objects.  This is a cobination of k30ccode.py and modlecurve.py.

In order to use you must have the following packages installed:

batman - a library used to model light curves when given a set of parameters.
kplr - an API used to access kepler data.
emcee - A Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm toolkit by Dan Foreman-Mackey
matplotlib- a python plotting library based off of the matlab plotting libraries.
numpy - a toolkit that makes it easier to work with arrays in python.
 
Some examples of plots are shown in the phtotos directory. I also have included some examples on how to create models of light curves and how to pull in data using kplr. I have also included a code that tests emcee to help debug any problems(This code was written by Dan Foreman-Mackey.).

To use generalcode.py:

-k : KOI number used to identify object
--get_light_curves: This will cache the lightcurves you are looking for in the kplr folder.
--normalize: This will normalize the light curves and save the output in a file.
--optimize: Will read in the file from normalize and optimize parameters (Might need some tinkering if you            want to incorporate different parameters to be optimized)
--final_plots: Will read in the samples and create a triangle and fitted plot.
