HOW TO USE THIS CODE
Run the name_pending code with the following command line arguments...
- your SDSS fits file
- your mock data file
- "--outfilename" followed by your desired outfile name

The code will run, leaving you with three frequency arrays for DD, RR, and DR. These will be appropriately named as part of your outfile. These arrays can be run through the "corr_est" function in "jem_utitilies" and plotted utilizing the "corr_plot" function.    

More coming soon...
